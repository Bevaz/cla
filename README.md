# Contributors License Agreements

This repository serves as the umbrella project to manage contributors license agreements at GNS3. Learn how to contribute to GNS3 and to sign up as a contributor.

Note to Contributors
--------------------

We at GNS3 are eager to work with you. For small changes — little bugfixes, correcting typos, and the like — please just submit pull requests to any of our projects. For larger changes, though, we have to ask you to jump through a little hoop.

In particular, in order for us to accept any major patches from you, you will have to electronically sign a statement that indicates two things:

* You are willingly licensing your contributions under the terms of the open source license of the project that you’re contributing to.
* You are legally able to license your contributions as stated.

The reason we do this is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we don’t “taint” the projects we manage with contributions that turn out to be improper. This protects everyone who wants to use the projects, including you!

Once you sign the Contributor License Agreement (the “CLA”), we will then be able to merge your contributions with a clear conscience and with only the friction that results from the usual technical back-and-forth of a vibrant open source project.

To get started with this process, visit the [Sign the CLA page](cla.md).

For reference, the standard open source license used by GNS3 is the [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 3](LICENSE).
