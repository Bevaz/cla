The purpose of this Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”) is to clarify and define the rights and obligations of you, as the contributor of certain code or works (your “Contribution”) to GNS3 Technologies, Inc., (“GNS3”) as the recipient of your Contribution, and inclusion in GNS3’s platform and interactive services (the “GNS3 Platform”) by users of your Contribution (“Users”).

The term Contribution includes any original work of authorship, modifications or additions to an existing work, bug reports, and suggested patches that you submit to GNS3 for inclusion in the GNS3 Platform, unless you clearly mark such submission with **"THIS IS NOT A CONTRIBUTION."**.

By submitting Contribution, you grant to GNS3 and all Users a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works.

You represent and promise that your Contribution is an original work that was authored by you and that neither GNS3 nor any User will be subject to any claim that use of your Contribution infringes any rights of any third party. If any other person or entity has any rights in your Contribution, then you represent and promise that such person has granted you express and unconditional permission to license the Contribution on the terms of this CLA.

You agree that if we receive any claims alleging that your Contribution infringes any proprietary or intellectual property rights of any third party, you will be responsible for the claim, including defending us against any claim based solely on your contribution.

This CLA and the licenses you grant to your Contribution are perpetual unless terminated by GNS3.

This CLA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta, Canada and the United States and any dispute relating to your Contribution or this CLA will be resolved only in the state and federal courts located in Calgary, Canada.
